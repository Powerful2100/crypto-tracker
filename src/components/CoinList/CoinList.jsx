                   * 
                   * There are multiple options what key can be:
                   *    - in our case can be coin ticker (every unique)
                   *    - can also be made using UUID - npm package - glej uuid.txt
                   *          <Coin key={value.key} name={value.name} ticker={value.ticker} price={value.price} />      
                   * 
                   * We can also do this:
                   *  this.state.coinData.map(value => 
                   *    <Coin key={value.ticker} {...value} />  
                   *  )
                   * ...value - is a spread operator that enumerates, spreads the key value pairs in component as props.
                   *  {
                   *    name: "Bitcoin",
                   *    ticker: "BTC"
                   *  }
                   *  This would give a Coin compoenent name="Bitcoin" and ticker="BTC" properties!
